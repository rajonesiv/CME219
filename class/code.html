            <h3>What is HTML &amp; CSS?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>HTML</strong> stands for
                <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> and is the backbone of web content. HTML formats text in a way that allows
                browsers to properly display your content. By using this universal code, all browsers can read and display
                webpages from all around the world.</p>
            <p>
                <b>CSS</b>, or
                <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i>, styles your html content. Through CSS, you can choose specific fonts, colors,
                and locations for your content. You can also add other stylistic elements such as background pictures, buttons,
                and boxes with drop shadows to further style your content. CSS can take a rather plain webpage and make it
                look more like a work of art.</p>
            <h3>Why learn HTML &amp; CSS?</h3>
            <p>Many believe using WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) editors are good enough; there is no reason to really
                learn HTML or CSS. Although these editors do allow you to create a web page, they often do not create valid
                code. These editors often go against industry best practices and often make your site look amateurish.</p>
            <p>In today's job market, especially in the media industry, you would be hard pressed to find a job that did not
                come in contact with web development in some way. Even if it is simply updating an email address or completely
                redesigning a website, knowing HTML and CSS will allow you easily make these changes and become a valuable
                skill in the job market. </p>
            <h3>How do I get started?</h3>
            <p>Taking this course is a great first step. You will learn the basics of HTML, some of the nuances of HTML5 and
                then learn to style your content like an expert using CSS. If you want some extra help, make sure you visit
                the resources page.
